 SELECT *

-- What is the total money in in the table?
SELECT SUM(money_in)
FROM transactions;

-- It was reported that Bitcoin dominates Fiddy Cent’s exchange. Let’s see if it is true within these dates by answering two questions:
-- 1. How many money in transactions are in this table?
-- 2. How many money in transactions are in this table where ‘BIT’ is the currency?
SELECT COUNT(money_in)
FROM transactions;

SELECT COUNT(money_in)
FROM transactions
WHERE currency = 'BIT';

-- What was the largest transaction in this whole table? Was it money in or money out?
SELECT MAX(money_in)
FROM transactions;

SELECT MAX(money_out)
FROM transactions;

-- What is the average money_in in the table for the currency Ethereum (‘ETH’)?
SELECT AVG(money_in)
FROM transactions
WHERE currency = 'ETH';

-- Let’s build a ledger for the different dates. Select date, average money_in, and average money_out from the table. And group everything by date.
SELECT date, ROUND(AVG(money_in),2) AS "Average BY", ROUND(AVG(money_out),2) AS "Average Sell"
FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;
