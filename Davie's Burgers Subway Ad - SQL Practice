SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

-- Use DISTINCT to find out all the unique order_date values in this table.
SELECT DISTINCT(order_date)
FROM orders
ORDER BY order_date DESC;

-- The special_instructions column stores the data where Davie’s Burgers customers leave a note for the kitchen or the delivery. Write a query that selects only the special_instructions column.Limit the result to 20 rows.

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 20;

-- Sort the instructions in alphabetical order (A-Z).

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY special_instructions ASC;

-- Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘sauce’.

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
AND special_instructions LIKE "%sauce%";

-- Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘door’.

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
AND special_instructions LIKE "%door%";

-- Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘box’.

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
AND special_instructions LIKE "%box%";

-- Instead of just returning the special instructions, also return their order ids. For more readability: Rename id as ‘#’ Rename special_instructions as ‘Notes’

SELECT id AS '#', special_instructions AS 'Notes'
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
AND special_instructions LIKE "%box%";
